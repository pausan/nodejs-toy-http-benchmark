# Nodejs http/https benchmark

Simple HTTP/HTTPS benchmark of different HTTP/HTTPS frameworks

All programs have these routes defined in this order:

```
/hey -> "Hey!"
/hell -> "Hell!"
/hello -> "Hello World!"
/about -> "<html><body>About page</body></html>"
/\* -> otherwise 404 with "Not Found"
```

The reason to have several paths starting with the same prefix is to somehow
test a little bit the performance of the routing of the different libraries.

## Benchmark

Initially I used autocannon which is in node and allowed me to easily gather
data as js object, but it was launched in the same process and consuming a lot
of computing, so I decided to do it better and use `wrk` with a script to
easily parse JSON output.

A better testing methodology would require running the server and the
performance load in different machines, running the server & load tool with
different threads, etc... but this will do the trick.

Run with this command:

```bash
$ node bench-all.js
```

```
Configuration:
  Node Version:  v20.10.0
  CPU Model:     Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz
  Path:          /hello
  Duration:      10 s
  Connections:   100
```

## Manual benchmark with wrk

You can launch all servers in parallel by executing:

```bash
$ node run-all.js
```

And then, for each port opened in the previous command, you can manually run
something like this:

```bash
wrk --timeout 5s -t 1 -c 100 -d 3s http://localhost:3000/hello
```
